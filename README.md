# optimisation-score

This automation was developed as part of my role as the optimisation lead across Video, Display, and PMAX products.

I've used SQL to query APAC optiscore table and send AUNZ data to a google spreadsheet and set up an automation using Apps Script to send out an email to relevant Account Managers on a fortnightly basis.

Please use nbviewer <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/j-karn/optimisation-score/blob/main/optiscore_email.ipynb">link here</a> if the notebook doesn't render. 

Here's an example of the automated email output:
