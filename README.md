# optimisation-score

This automation was developed as part of my role leading the optimisation across Video, Display, and PMAX products.

I've used SQL to query the optiscore, an estimate of how well your Google Ads account is set to perform, from APAC database and send AUNZ data to a google spreadsheet and set up an automation using Apps Script to send out an email to relevant Account Managers on a fortnightly basis.

Please use nbviewer <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/j-karn/optimisation-score/blob/main/optiscore_email.ipynb">link here</a> if the notebook doesn't render accurately. 

Here's an example of the automated email output:
